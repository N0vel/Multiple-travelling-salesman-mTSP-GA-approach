# Multiple-travelling-salesman-mTSP-GA-approach
Solution to mTSP using genetic algorithms. To create it I've used this article: http://www.qjie.ir/article_89_fd3d6037a76015c814dd3d82969392c0.pdf

This code was created in zeitnot, but then it became unneeded, so don't expect pretty object-oriented programming, comments and optimally written program logic.

Though I like on the fly plotting of the current best set of paths, it bewitches me in the same way as a reducing loss during training of neural networks.
